The User Contribution Summary tool intends to value the contribution of the wikipedia editors. Therefore , having a personal profile which the editor or the author can present to the outside world would not only serve the purpose but will also grant him a sense of satisfaction. 

The following UI mockup highlights the contribution of the editor in an easy to understand manner and will also help to draw new editors to the project. It largely bears a resemblance to the existing wikimedia theme, so as to make it coherent . The features presented in the following mockup can be enumerated as follows :
The profile can switched between four sections:
- My Profile 
- Badges
- Statistics 
- Articles

#### My Profile :
This page would provide a comprehensive detail about the user , in a manner that even if a person gives glance to it, he will able to perceive good amount of information from it. It consists of : 
1. Badges: featuring the highest views attained on an article, top 10 percentile, Multilingual contributions, no of edits made and no of articles authored.
Contribution Timeline: It is unique with the fact that, unlike the github contribution graph, it also summarises all the years of wikipedia editing , form joing year till present. The size of bubble indicates the size of contribution made during that year. Clicking on bubble of any year opens up the graph , which is laid down in horizontal calendar format , just as our eyes are accustomed to watching. The intensity of green dots , define the size contribution. 
2. Flag: Flag indicate whether the contributor is a master contributor. For newbies , it will in “yet to come” format.
3. Doughnut Chart: It tells the different languages in which contributions have been done.
4. Sections for the maximum viewed article, featured article and most thanked article.
5. Section containing information about all edits i.e. first edit , first article, total views, daily readers, last edit, last article.

#### Badges : 
This would contain detailed information about when the badges were earned , on which article it was earned and other relevant information
 
#### Statistics : 
It contains graphs of year count, month count, timecard, articles written, articles edited and talk 
#### Articles :
It would present all the Featured articles, Most Viewed articles, Latest edits, Top edited pages.
4 buttons(categories) organised vertically as-
- Featured article
- Most viewed
- Latest edits
- Top edited pages (with most thank value)

On selecting any of such category rolls the respective articles on the right. Each article in this list include-
- Title of page.
- Basic edit status as- “created on 13 October 2017 at 10:41

Such a system of presentation, will motivate the editors to contribute more and will also avoid a sense of comparison between different editors.
