# Wikimedia Microtasks

Wikipedia evolves because of its editors who add the valuable content to it. Unfortunately our authors are unable to claim their credit for the value added to wikimedia. This project is desired to motivate wikimedia contributors by showcasing their contribution. This project will also be a public profile to attract more contributors to our organization.

Please refer to the following link to run the and check the tools - http://tools.wmflabs.org/devys 

This repository contains 5 microtasks developed as a part of Outreachy Round 15, while contributing to Wikimedia Foundations.
The microtasks developed are in form of PRs':
# 1. User Contribution Summary
A simple tool that takes a username and lists the recent English Wikipedia edits of that user

# 2. User Percentile
A simple tool that takes a username and tells what percentile the user is at by number of edits.

# 3. Design Mockups
Design mockups and detailed explaination for project, "tool to display user contribution summary"

# 4. User edit analysis
A simple tool that takes a username and provides edit quality and article quality analysis of last 5 edits made by user.

# 5. Article View Count
